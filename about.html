<h1>Something about Be Happy</h1>

      <p1> <center>This webpage has been designed for women who have been through a traumatic experience and are unable to seek professional help 
	  as they are either too scared or too depressed to take action. This web-app aims to help these women take baby steps to overcome the hardship and be in a place where they can be a part of the society again. Undergoing an experience of such magnitude can be traumatising and a person can shut themself in and everyone else out. The hope of this app is to help women understand that the injustice that happened was not their fault and they should not blame themselves and be depressed. They should find it in them to fight the fight and help themselves get justice. This app is the first step in the many that the woman will have to take to overcome the horrific experience.</center></p1>
